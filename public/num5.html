    <h3>Exploration 5: The Martian</h3>
    <p>For my 5th and final exploration, I read and then watched The Martian (2h 31m).
        First, I read the book, published in 2011. I found it interesting that the author,
        Andy Weir, originally published it one chapter at a time on his website. I enjoyed
        reading it so much I decided to watch the movie. It was one of my favorite sci-fi
        movies. It was very well done, with a main theme the stark contrast between the high-tech
        Hab, ships, and Earth and the wild environment of Mars that Mark Watney (Matt Damon) needed
        to survive. I also liked the scenes where Watney talked directly to the cameras, which made
        up the majority of the book. The book acted mostly as Watneyâ€™s journal, with other chapters
        added in about what was going on at NASA and with his crew.</p>
