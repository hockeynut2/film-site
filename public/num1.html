    <h3>Exploration 1: Doctor Strange</h3>
    <p>I saw the new Marvel movie Doctor Strange (1h 55m).
        I was stunned by the special effects that I almost forgot it was a Marvel movie.
        Afterwards, I read the below review. It aligned with my thoughts about the movie
        entirely. I thought Benedict Cumberbatch was a great choice as
        Doctor Strange, and the rest of the cast fit well too. It also felt a lot like
        Inception (2010), with the special effects appearing to allow the characters to
        defy gravity and physics. As a fan of superhero movies, I was excited for Doctor
        Strange because it was supposed to be very different from others. I really enjoyed
        it and watched it more for enjoyment than for analysis.</p>
