    <h3>Exploration 2: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</h3>
    <p>Last night, I saw the Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts (2h 13m).
        I expected it to feel like the previous Harry Potter movies but with a
        more lighthearted or upbeat mood, and I was not surprised. It seemed
        weaker than the other movies, but this was expected given that no book
        was written beforehand (unlike the other Harry Potter movies). An example
        of the lightheartedness is this scene, where Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne)
        shakes down his pet Niffler, a creature known for stealing. Although the
        other movies have some similar comic scenes, they were far more frequent
        in Fantastic Beasts. This was a good spin-off to a great movie series.</p>
