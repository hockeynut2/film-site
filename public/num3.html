    <h3>Exploration 3: 12 Angry Men</h3>
    <p>I was looking for an older movie to watch because the rest of mine were
        in theaters recently, and I settled upon 12 Angry Men (1h 36m). For those who
        don’t know, 12 Angry Men is about a jury deciding whether to convict a
        teenager of killing his father, needing a unanimous vote either way. At
        the beginning, 11 vote guilty, but juror #8 (Henry Fonda) votes not guilty,
        wishing to re-examine the case. He aims to provide a “reasonable doubt” as
        to whether the boy is guilty, and the rest of the movie is him picking apart
        the case of the prosecution. I really enjoyed the logic that was presented on
        both sides and following the men of the jury as they wonder whether the boy is
        definitely guilty.</p>
